# Project Explanation
This interface demonstrates a webpage that could be used for an educational website. This site is
focused towards teaching children about some different types of animals. It utilizes a single page
navigation in order to quickly and efficiently change between the different content in the
nav bar.

## Cosmetics
After conducting a self-review, I decided to alter the colors and typeface. I wanted to convey
colors and typeface that were fun to cater towards children and yet also suggest a nature theme 
to fit the animal theme. The typeface also had to be legible as the information is the main attraction.
I was severely limited by the fonts that would actually show up when running the project, but in the
end, I found some basic fonts that were satisfactory.

## How to recreate this project
To create the app, I followed the tutorial from 
https://www.kirupa.com/react/creating_single_page_app_react_using_react_router.htm
called "Creating a Single-Page App in React using React Router" (kirupa, n.d.)
With node.js and Microsoft Visual Studio Code installed, I first created this project using the 
"create-react-app <name>" command, ignoring the quotes. I then used the cd command to change to the 
app's directory, and then the "npm i react-router-dom --save" command.

In order to run the project, I used the "npm start" command. From there, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/
in your browser to see the webpage. Additional info may be found in the default README info found below

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
